                <h2>What is a Siberian Husky ?</h2>
                <p>Siberian Huskies are a medium-sized working dog breed known for their endurance and ability to pull 
                    sleds over long distances. Here are some key characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Origin:</b>They were originally bred by the Chukchi people of northeastern Asia for sled pulling and companionship.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Appearance: </b>They have a thick double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings. Their coat colors can range from black to pure white, often with striking facial markings.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Size: </b>Males typically weigh between 45-60 pounds (20-27 kg) and stand 21-23.5 inches (53-60 cm) tall. Females are slightly smaller, weighing 35-50 pounds (16-23 kg) and standing 20-22 inches (51-56 cm) tall.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Temperament: </b>Siberian Huskies are known for being friendly, gentle, and alert. They are also very energetic and require regular exercise.</li><br>
                    <li><b>History: </b>They gained fame in 1925 during the "serum run" to Nome, Alaska, where teams of Huskies helped deliver diphtheria antitoxin across treacherous terrain.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h2>Balto! The Hero of Nome, Alaska</h2>
                <p>One of the most famous Siberian Huskies is Balto. He gained fame for his role in the 1925 serum run 
                    to Nome, Alaska, where he led a team of sled dogs through harsh conditions to deliver diphtheria 
                    antitoxin, saving many lives. Balto's story has been celebrated in books, movies, and even a statue 
                    in Central Park, New York</p><br>

                <h2>His Heroics Journey:</h2>
                <p>Balto's heroic journey is a remarkable story of bravery and endurance. In January 1925, the remote town 
                    of Nome, Alaska, faced a deadly diphtheria outbreak. The only way to get the life-saving antitoxin to 
                    the town was through a relay of dog sled teams covering nearly 700 miles in harsh winter conditions.</p>
                <p>Balto was part of the final leg of this relay, led by musher Gunnar Kaasen. Despite blizzard conditions, 
                    temperatures dropping to -40Â°F, and near whiteout visibility, Balto and his team pressed on. On February 
                    2, 1925, they successfully delivered the antitoxin to Nome, saving countless lives</p>
                <p>Balto's journey made him an international hero. He was celebrated with a statue in Central Park, New York, 
                    which honors the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed the antitoxin. Balto's story has been 
                    immortalized in books, movies, and even a statue in Cleveland, where he spent his final years.</p>
