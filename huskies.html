                            <h1>Baby Yuki</h1>
                            <p>Yuki came to in our lifes on November 12th, 2012.  He was 3 months old at the time.  I was very lucky to 
                                have found an add for him on Craiglist.  Another dog had bitten his tail when he was a baby and he had 
                                lost some fur on his tail.  He was a 'damaged' dog and that is why he was not sold as a baby.  He is 
                                absolutley not damaged good, he is the best dog I have ever had.  He is very smart and very loving.</p>
                            <p>Yuki is a Siberian Husky and he is a very good example of the breed.  He was a wild animal when we 
                                got him.  It was a challenge to train him, but it was worth the time and effort.  He does not run 
                                away like other Huskeys do.  He is very loyal and he is always by our side.  He is a very good dog.</p>

                            <p>Huskeys are pack dogs.  They love being around people and small children.  I trusted Yuki when my 
                                nephew Alex was a baby and Yuki was always very loving to him.  He would lay down next to him.</p>
                            <p>Yuki is AWLWAYS happy when my friends come over.  As soon as he sees a car pull over, he gets 
                                very excited and lets everyone know that someone is here and he is ready to welcome them every 
                                single time.</p>

                            <p>Yuki turned 12 years old on August 16th and he is around 70lbs now.  We are blessed that he is a helathy dog.  He has some arthitis now, 
                                but he is still very active.  He loves to play with his toys and he loves to go for walks.  He is 
                                very smart and he knows when it is time to go for a walk.  He will let us know when it is time to go 
                                for a walk.</p>
                            <p>Yuki has been with me throught some hard life events, and he never left my side.  I don't know why 
                                he seemed to know I needed something to hold on to.  He is my big baby and I love him very much. I 
                                want to spend as much time as I can with him because he is getting old now and I know we don't have 
                                much time left together.</p>

                            <p>The story how we got Little Milo is probably very sweet.  Milos sibling live just across the street. 
                                One evening, my wife and I were going somewhere and we saw our neighbors walking his three dogs, 
                                strange becuase he used to only have one. He had two baby huskies with him, he told us this person 
                                had rescued them and was trying to get a home for a few more. My wife gave me the look and I knew 
                                we were about to get another dog.</p>
                            <p>We decided to go with Little Milo since he was clearly the runt of the litter and we 'thought' he was 
                                going to not be too much trouble.  We were wrong.  He is a very active dog and he is our little 
                                convict now.  And I would not change anything from him!</p>

                            <p>Milo was a little thing.  He used to fit in my hand when we first got him, but he started to grow 
                                once we dewormed him.  He also got stronger and more active.  Yuki helped me train him and Milo, 
                                like Yuki, is very good off the leash... that is if non of my neighbors are around becuase he HAS 
                                TO go say hello to everyone! </p>
                            <p>Milo is another good example of a husky. He is loving, fun, energetic and he howls!  Not a lot, 
                                but he does from time to time.  He is very good with kids and with other dogs.  He is very happy 
                                when his brother and sister some for play dates.  He is a very good and loyal dog.</p>

                            <p>Milo is grown up now.  But unlike his older brother Yuki, Milo is only 40lbs.  He is our 
                                Little Baby in contrast to Yuki.</p>
                            <p>Milos is also the toy horder of the two but Yuki doesn't mind.  Milo was not Yukis favorite 
                                when we first got him, but now they are inseparable.  They are always together and they 
                                always play together.</p>
